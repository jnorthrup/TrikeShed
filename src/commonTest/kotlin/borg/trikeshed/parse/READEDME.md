Based on the provided code, I'll summarize the key aspects and idioms used in this JSON and CSV parsing implementation:

1. Bitmap-based parsing:
- Both JSON and CSV use a bitmap encoding scheme to represent state transitions and lexer events.
- Each input byte is encoded into 4 bits (2 bits for state events, 2 bits for lexer events).

2. Enums for state representation:
- `JsStateEvent` and `CsvStateEvent` for JSON and CSV state transitions.
- `LexerEvents` for handling quotes, escapes, and UTF-8 characters.

3. Efficient encoding and decoding:
- `encode` function converts input bytes to bitmap representation.
- `decode` function processes the bitmap to extract state information.

4. State machine implementation:
- Uses counters for quotes and escapes to handle nested structures.
- Masks certain events based on the current state (e.g., ignoring delimiters inside quotes).

5. Memory-efficient processing:
- Reuses input array for output, overwriting with decoded information.

6. Bitwise operations:
- Extensive use of bitwise operations for efficient encoding and decoding.

7. Extension functions:
- `z` and `nz` extension properties on Int for zero and non-zero checks.

8. Type aliases and custom operators:
- `CharSeries` used as an alias for character sequences.
- Custom operators like `j` (likely for creating Join instances).

9. JSON-specific features:
- Path-based access to JSON elements (`jsPath` function).
- Reification of JSON structure into Kotlin data types.

10. Testing:
- Use of `kotlin.test` for unit testing.
- Test cases for both JSON and CSV parsing.

11. File I/O:
- `Files.readAllLines` used for reading test input.

12. Unsigned types:
- Extensive use of unsigned byte arrays (`UByteArray`) for processing.

Key idioms:
1. Bitmap-based state representation for efficient parsing.
2. Lazy evaluation through the use of lambdas in enum predicates.
3. Bitwise operations for compact state encoding and decoding.
4. Reuse of memory buffers to minimize allocations.
5. Separation of concerns between lexing (character-level events) and parsing (structural events).

This implementation aims for high performance and memory efficiency in parsing JSON and CSV, using low-level bit manipulation techniques while providing a higher-level API for JSON traversal and reification.
