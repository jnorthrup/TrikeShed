/**
 * A [SortedMap] extended with navigation methods returning the
 * closest matches for given search targets. Methods
 * [.lowerEntry], [.floorEntry], [.ceilingEntry],
 * and [.higherEntry] return `Map.Entry` objects
 * associated with keys respectively less than, less than or equal,
 * greater than or equal, and greater than a given key, returning
 * `null` if there is no such key.  Similarly, methods
 * [.lowerKey], [.floorKey], [.ceilingKey], and
 * [.higherKey] return only the associated keys. All of these
 * methods are designed for locating, not traversing entries.
 *
 *
 * A `NavigableMap` may be accessed and traversed in either
 * ascending or descending key order.  The [.descendingMap]
 * method returns a view of the map with the senses of all relational
 * and directional methods inverted. The performance of ascending
 * operations and views is likely to be faster than that of descending
 * ones.  Methods
 * [subMap(K, boolean, K, boolean)][.subMap],
 * [headMap(K, boolean)][.headMap], and
 * [tailMap(K, boolean)][.tailMap]
 * differ from the like-named `SortedMap` methods in accepting
 * additional arguments describing whether lower and upper bounds are
 * inclusive versus exclusive.  Submaps of any `NavigableMap`
 * must implement the `NavigableMap` interface.
 *
 *
 * This interface additionally defines methods [.firstEntry],
 * [.pollFirstEntry], [.lastEntry], and
 * [.pollLastEntry] that return and/or remove the least and
 * greatest mappings, if any exist, else returning `null`.
 *
 *
 * Implementations of entry-returning methods are expected to
 * return `Map.Entry` pairs representing snapshots of mappings
 * at the time they were produced, and thus generally do *not*
 * support the optional `Entry.setValue` method. Note however
 * that it is possible to change mappings in the associated map using
 * method `put`.
 *
 *
 * Methods
 * [subMap(K, K)][.subMap],
 * [headMap(K)][.headMap], and
 * [tailMap(K)][.tailMap]
 * are specified to return `SortedMap` to allow existing
 * implementations of `SortedMap` to be compatibly retrofitted to
 * implement `NavigableMap`, but extensions and implementations
 * of this interface are encouraged to override these methods to return
 * `NavigableMap`.  Similarly,
 * [.keySet] can be overridden to return [NavigableSet].
 *
 *
 * This interface is a member of the
 * [
 * Java Collections Framework]({@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework).
