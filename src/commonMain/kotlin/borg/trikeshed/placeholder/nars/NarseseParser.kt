 single char strings should be Char not String
 opening Char and String should use  +x operator
 a[b] is preferable to a(--b) however --b is necessary for opening parser in a parse expression
 a b is preferable to a and b , also preferable to a + b
kotlin operator precedence is not the same as parser precedence, so we need to use parens to make it work

narsese (oPennars) grammar
 <symbol> is a nonterminal (variable) and the __expression__ consists of one or more sequences of either terminal or nonterminal symbols;
 ::= means that the symbol on the left must be replaced with the expression on the right.
  more sequences [of symbols] are separated by the vertical bar '|', indicating a choice, the whole being a possible substitution for the symbol on the left.
 '#' as a token prefix indicates regex pattern
 { } around a construction indicates a repeating group
