# TrikeShed Local-First Reactor / litebike Taxonomy Integration

This is the architectural worklog and task queue for dividing the TrikeShed
KMP targets into inheritance-based domains around a shared, addressable reactor
blackboard. It preserves the `Join`/`Series`/`Cursor` algebra in `commonMain`
and adapts the `../litebike/` taxonomy into the TrikeShed source tree.

## Core hierarchy (non-designated NUID -> subnets -> workgroups -> capabilities)

```
NUID = capability + nonce + subnet
    |
    +-- subnet  (e.g., local, lan.localhost, mesh.worker.<id>, global.relay)
    |       |
    |       +-- workgroup  (a set of workers registered on a reactor slot)
    |               |
    |               +-- capability  (process, CAS, wireproto, sctp, mesh, modelmux, ...)
```

Capabilities are traits. Workgroups advertise a `TraitSpace`. Subnets scope
where a NUID is valid. The undesignated random nonce makes each NUID a bearer
token, not an identity.

## DRY chokepoints (must remain thin and stable)

1. `Reactor` — `WamBlock`, `SessionState`, `TransformCode`, `Protocol` from litebike.
2. `Nuid` — `Join<Capability, Join<Nonce, Subnet>>` authorization context.
3. `Volume` — `BlockArray` + `BootBlock` block storage surface.
4. `ReactorEndpoint` — `ReactorAction`/`ReactorResult` request/response algebra.

All higher layers (CAS, wireproto, mesh, modelmux, litebike gates) must use
these interfaces. No platform IO leaks into `commonMain`.

## Platform targets

- `commonMain` — algebra and shared interfaces only.
- `jvmMain`/`nativeMain` — real Btrfs/JBOD userspace, io_uring, posix sockets.
- `jsMain` — Node localhost proxy and browser PWA runtime.
- `wasmJsMain` — browser PWA with localStorage/IndexedDB/OPFS backends.

## Task DAG (Jules-sized domains)

### Foundation layer (must land first)

- [ ] **T1. Reactor algebra in commonMain**
  - Port `Protocol`, `WamBlock`, `SessionState`, `TransformCode` from litebike taxonomy.
  - Define `ReactorError`, `ChannelMessage`, `ChannelResponse`, `ReactorConfig`.
  - Keep it pure Join/Series/Cursor-shaped.
  - Targets: `commonMain`.
  - Evidence: compiles in `commonMain`, unit tests for protocol ID round-trip and transform identity.

- [ ] **T2. NUID / authorization algebra in commonMain**
  - `Nuid`, `Capability`, `Nonce`, `Subnet` as data classes / typealiases.
  - `TraitSpace` matching `capability` against a worker's advertised traits.
  - Subnet routing prefix rules.
  - Targets: `commonMain`.
  - Evidence: compiles, tests for trait matching and subnet containment.

- [ ] **T3. Volume / BlockArray / BootBlock interface in commonMain**
  - `Volume` interface: `blockSize`, `capacity`, `read(lba, count)`, `write(lba, data)`, `sync()`.
  - `BlockArray` and `BootBlock` helpers on top of `Volume`.
  - Targets: `commonMain`.
  - Evidence: compiles, tests for in-memory `Volume` backend.

- [ ] **T4. ReactorEndpoint / confix wire transport in commonMain**
  - `ReactorAction` and `ReactorResult` as `Join<Nuid, Join<Verb, Payload>>` and response envelope.
  - `ReactorEndpoint` interface: `invoke(action) -> result`.
  - Confix serialization for action/result payloads.
  - Targets: `commonMain`.
  - Evidence: compiles, round-trip serialize a NUID-authorized action.

### Storage backend layer (parallel after T3)

- [ ] **T5. Native Volume backend**
  - `PosixVolume` using existing `PosixFileOperations`.
  - `LiburingVolume` for async batching on Linux.
  - Targets: `nativeMain` (`posixMain` / `linuxMain`).
  - Evidence: native tests pass on Linux; macOS uses posix fallback.

- [ ] **T6. Btrfs userspace JBOD backend**
  - `BtrfsVolume` implementing `Volume` by parsing superblock, chunk tree, device tree.
  - Built on top of `Volume`, not replacing it.
  - Targets: `jvmMain`/`nativeMain` (mmap + io_uring).
  - Evidence: can read a raw Btrfs image or JBOD array metadata.

- [ ] **T7. Browser storage backend**
  - `OpfsVolume` and `IndexedDbVolume` implementing `Volume` over browser storage APIs.
  - Block semantics emulated; no real Btrfs in the browser.
  - Targets: `jsMain`/`wasmJsMain`.
  - Evidence: browser tests or headless JS test for read/write block round-trip.

### Transport / proxy layer (parallel after T1, T2, T4)

- [ ] **T8. Node localhost proxy**
  - `NodeReactorEndpoint` in `jsMain` that wraps `FetchReactorEndpoint`.
  - Server-side forwarder that accepts `/api` actions and routes to a local `Reactor`.
  - Targets: `jsMain` + JVM/Native server.
  - Evidence: PWA can connect to `localhost:PORT` and invoke a ping action.

- [ ] **T9. Mesh / SCTP transport**
  - `MeshReactorEndpoint` and `SctpReactorEndpoint` implementing `ReactorEndpoint`.
  - Peer discovery over the reactor blackboard.
  - Targets: `commonMain` interfaces; native implementations.
  - Evidence: two native peers exchange a NUID-authorized action over loopback.

- [ ] **T10. litebike gate / tunnel adaptation**
  - Port litebike `Protocol`, `rbcursive`, `gates` into `commonMain` taxonomy.
  - `Tunnel` interface; SSH / shadowsocks / SOCKS5 / proxy backends in native.
  - Browser uses `ReactorEndpoint` to ask a native/node peer to open a tunnel.
  - Targets: `commonMain` + `nativeMain`/`jvmMain` + `jsMain`.
  - Evidence: protocol detection test; native SSH exec round-trip (or mock).

### Workers / capabilities layer (parallel after T2, T4, T7, T8, T9, T10)

- [ ] **T11. CAS worker**
  - Content-addressed store (`CasStore`) on `Volume`.
  - Manifest CIDs, deterministic archives, replication hooks.
  - Targets: `commonMain` + platform backends.
  - Evidence: `ContentId` round-trip, manifest CID deterministic across runs.

- [ ] **T12. Process worker**
  - `Process` capability using existing `PosixProcessOperations` (moved to macOS/linux).
  - NUID-authorized process spawn/exec over the reactor.
  - Targets: `nativeMain`.
  - Evidence: spawn `echo` via reactor action, receive stdout as result.

- [ ] **T13. Wireproto / Confix worker**
  - Serialize/deserialize `ReactorAction` over wireproto.
  - Path/cursor transport over `ReactorEndpoint`.
  - Targets: `commonMain`.
  - Evidence: round-trip a cursor through a wireproto-encoded action.

- [ ] **T14. ModelMux worker**
  - Port litebike `keymux` model facade / DSEL / provider selection.
  - Model invocation as a `ReactorAction` proxied to a model worker.
  - Targets: `commonMain` + `ReactorEndpoint`.
  - Evidence: provider selection rule resolves; model request routes to a mock worker.

### UI / blackboard layer (last)

- [ ] **T15. PWA / gallery UI**
  - Forge gallery / blackboard renderer in `wasmJs`/`js`.
  - Talks to localhost Node proxy or degrades to offline OPFS.
  - Targets: `jsMain`/`wasmJsMain`.
  - Evidence: browser build passes, gallery renders from a test blackboard.

## Target-feature bijection for the HTML window manager

The Forge window manager should be a single HTML/DOM shell in
`src/commonMain/resources`, rendered on every platform by a per-target
`ForgeWindowManager` SPI. `manimwm-tk` is retained as a native desktop
render/composit layer, not as the window manager.

Per-target mapping:

| Target | `ForgeWindowManager` impl | Display surface | Storage prefix | Network |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `jvm` | `JvmForgeWindowManager` | Compose + embedded browser (JCEF/WebView) or external browser | `.local/forge` | JVM sockets |
| `macos`/`linux` | `NativeForgeWindowManager` | system browser or embedded WebView (optional) | `.local/forge` | native sockets |
| `js` (node) | `NodeForgeWindowManager` | serve HTML to browser, or headless | `.local/forge` | node sockets |
| `wasmJs` (browser) | `BrowserForgeWindowManager` | browser DOM | OPFS/IndexedDB | fetch/WebSocket |
| `android` | `AndroidForgeWindowManager` | WebView | app storage | Android sockets |
| `wasi` | `WasiForgeWindowManager` | none / textual | WASM sandbox | WASI sockets |

- [ ] **T16. Define `ForgeWindowManager` SPI in commonMain**
  - Interface: `bind(html)`, `injectScript`, `dispatchEvent`, `captureSnapshot`.
  - Targets: `commonMain`.
  - Evidence: compiles; all existing targets have a no-op or real implementation.

- [ ] **T17. Move HTML shell assets into `src/commonMain/resources`**
  - Currently `src/jsMain/resources/index.html` + inline `forgeAppHtml()`.
  - Make `ForgeApp` generate from a shared HTML template, CSS, and JS snippets.
  - Targets: `commonMain` resources + `jsMain`/`wasmJsMain` consumers.
  - Evidence: `wasmJs`/`js` binaries still produce the same PWA; `index.html` still references `./TrikeShed.js`.

- [ ] **T18. Implement per-target window managers**
  - `BrowserForgeWindowManager`: uses `document` (existing behavior in `wasmJs`/`js`).
  - `NodeForgeWindowManager`: serves HTML over local HTTP; opens system browser or stays headless.
  - `JvmForgeWindowManager`: serves HTML or embeds JCEF/JavaFX WebView inside Compose window.
  - `NativeForgeWindowManager`: serve HTML + system browser; optional native WebView.
  - `AndroidForgeWindowManager`: WebView wrapper.
  - `WasiForgeWindowManager`: textual/no-op.
  - Targets: per-target source sets.
  - Evidence: each target can launch and render the HTML shell; at least one platform test per implementation.

- [ ] **T19. Reposition `manimwm-tk` as a native render/composit layer**
  - `manimwm` keeps its SPI (`ManimWmSpi`) but is no longer the window manager.
  - Native desktop: the HTML window manager requests frames/textures from `manimwm` and positions them in the DOM via a canvas or WebGL surface.
  - Browser: `manimwm` can render to a `<canvas>`/WebGL if ported, or the browser uses its own animation layer.
  - Targets: `commonMain` interface; native/JVM implementations.
  - Evidence: a native desktop build shows the HTML shell with a manim-rendered canvas panel inside it.

- [ ] **T20. Add missing targets to Gradle build**
  - `android()` target with `androidMain` source set.
  - `wasmWasi()` target with `wasiMain` source set.
  - Ensure `composeCompiler` stays restricted to `KotlinPlatformType.jvm`.
  - Targets: `build.gradle.kts`.
  - Evidence: `./gradlew build` succeeds for new targets on host; non-host targets are ignored via `kotlin.native.ignoreDisabledTargets=true`.

- [ ] **T21. Align docs/ gh-pages with the shared HTML shell**
  - The `docs/` build is the same `src/commonMain/resources` HTML, packaged for static hosting.
  - Sync task must keep `<script src="./TrikeShed.js"></script>` verbatim.
  - Targets: `build.gradle.kts` sync task + `docs/`.
  - Evidence: `curl -s <gh-pages url> | grep TrikeShed.js` matches.

## Build / gateway discipline

- Every Jules task must keep its own slice green under `./gradlew build`.
- The global `./gradlew build` is a gateway check, not a long-running Jules session.
- Stale or broken tests should be excluded from compilation, not deleted, until reconciled.
- No platform IO or Btrfs code in `commonMain` or browser targets.

## Open questions / risks

- [ ] Linux `PosixProcessOperations` currently missing (file is in `macosMain`). Need `linuxMain` copy.
- [ ] `macosX64Main.dependsOn(macosMain)` triggers Gradle warning; may need to drop or rewire.
- [ ] `../litebike/` is Rust; porting `rbcursive` SIMD detection may require JVM Panama or native fallback.
- [ ] NUID key material / revocation story needs a concrete design before T2 is finalized.
- [ ] Browser PWA cannot open raw sockets; all tunneling must be proxy-mediated.
- [ ] `jvm` target currently uses Compose Desktop; embedding HTML means choosing JCEF, JavaFX WebView, or an external browser. Decision needed before T18.
- [ ] `wasmWasi` has no display; T18 will be a no-op/textual implementation. Need to confirm whether this is useful for a headless reactor worker.
- [ ] `android` target is not yet in build.gradle.kts; adding it requires Android Gradle Plugin and SDK setup.
